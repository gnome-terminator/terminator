  * Completely revamped config system which now transparently makes use
    of gconf settings if they are available, falls back to sensible

    from one and either scale the fontsize or not.

    translations. Closes LP #161120

    Terminator)

    gnome-terminal settings
  * Add Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab as options for switching terminals 
    (patch from Kees Cook)

    terminals and closing them. Closes LP #149931 and #148622(thanks 
    to Huanghe for patches for this)

    message
