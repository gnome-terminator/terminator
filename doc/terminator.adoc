== NAME
terminator - multiple GNOME terminals in one window

== SYNOPSIS
*terminator* [_options_]

== DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents *Terminator*, a terminal emulator application.

*Terminator* is a program that allows users to set up flexible
arrangements of GNOME terminals. It is aimed at those who normally
arrange lots of terminals near each other, but don't want to use a
frame based window manager.

== OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.

*-h*, *--help*::
Show summary of options.

*-v*, *--version*::
Show the version of the Terminator installation.

*-m*, *-M*, *--maximise*, *--maximize*::
Start with a maximised window.

*-f*, *--fullscreen*::
Start with a fullscreen window.

*-b*, *--borderless*::
Instruct the window manager not to render borders/decorations on the
Terminator window (this works well with --maximise).

*-H*, *--hidden*::
Hide the Terminator window by default. Its visibility can be toggled
with the *hide_window* keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+A by default).

*-T* _FORCEDTITLE_, **--title**=__FORCEDTITLE__::
Force the Terminator window to use a specific name rather than updating
it dynamically based on the wishes of the child shell.

**--geometry**=__GEOMETRY__::
Specify the preferred size and position of Terminator's window;
see *X*(7).

*-e* _COMMAND_, **--command**=__COMMAND__::
Run the specified command instead of the default shell or profile
specified command. +
Note: if Terminator is launched as x-terminal-emulator -e behaves like
-x, and the longform becomes --execute2=COMMAND.

*-x* _COMMAND_ [__ARGS__], **--execute**=__COMMAND__ [__ARGS__]::
Run *the rest of the command line* instead of the default shell or
profile specified command.

**--working-directory**=__DIR__::
Set the terminal's working directory.

*-g* _FILE_, **--config**=__FILE__::
Use the specified file for configuration.

// TODO --config-json option

*-r* _ROLE_, **--role**=__ROLE__::
Set a custom WM_WINDOW_ROLE property on the window.

*-l* _LAYOUT_, **--layout**=__LAYOUT__::
Start Terminator with a specific layout. The argument here is the name
of a saved layout.

*-s* _LAYOUT_, **--select-layout**=__LAYOUT__::
Open the layout launcher window instead of the normal terminal.

*-p*, **--profile**=__PROFILE__::
Use a different profile as the default.

*-i*, **--icon**=__FORCEDICON__::
Set a custom icon for the window (by file or name)

*-u*, *--no-dbus*::
Disable DBus.
// Could 'Start Terminator with DBus disabled.' be better?

*-d*, *--debug*::
Enable debugging output (please use this when reporting bugs). This can
be specified twice to enable a built-in python debugging server.

**--debug-classes**=__DEBUG_CLASSES__::
If this is specified as a comma separated list, debugging output will
only be printed from the specified classes.

**--debug-methods**=__DEBUG_METHODS__::
If this is specified as a comma separated list, debugging output will
only be printed from the specified functions. If this is specified in
addition to --debug-classes, only the intersection of the two lists will
be displayed.

*--new-tab*::
If this is specified and Terminator is already running, DBus will be
used to spawn a new tab in the first Terminator window.

*--toggle-visibility*::
If this is specified and Terminator is already running, DBus will be
used to toggle Terminator window visibility. Usable under Wayland to
replace hide keyboad shortcut.

== KEYBINDINGS
The following default keybindings can be used to control Terminator.
Most of these keybindings can be changed in the Preferences. Up to
two keybindings can be set per action.

*Drag and Drop*::
The layout can be modified by moving terminals with Drag and Drop.
To start dragging a terminal, click and hold on its titlebar.
Alternatively, hold down *Ctrl*, click and hold the *right* mouse button.
Then, *+**release Ctrl**+*. You can now drag the terminal to the point
