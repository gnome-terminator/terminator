terminator 0.7:

  * Fullscreen support, via a patch from Thomas Meire. Closes LP #178914
  * Improved behaviour when closing terminals/window. Result of work by Thomas
    Meire. Closes LP #161121
  * Freedesktop .desktop file and appropriate setup.py entry for installing
    it. Closes LP #178943
  * Translation support, with Spanish and Dutch translations. Closes LP
	  #161120
  * Stop clashing with gnome-terminal's paste shortcut key, move horizontal
	  splitting shortcut too, and add support for gnome-terminal's copy/paste 
		shortcuts. Closes LP #179310
  * Borderless support (tell your window manager not to decorate Terminator)
	* Font zooming support. Closes LP #178792

terminator 0.6:

  * Use new gnome-terminal gconf key to find available profiles
  * Move a few more hardcoded items to our settings array (not that it can be
    overridden yet)
  * Fix handling of exiting child processes to properly track gnome-terminal
    settings
  * Add Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab as options for switching terminals (patch
    from Kees Cook)
  * Stop using parent.show_all() when removing/adding a terminal and instead
    show the actual widgets that have been created. This prevents scrollbars
    from re-appearing after they have been hidden

terminator 0.5:

  * The terminator window is now able to resize smaller, thanks to Kees Cook
    for the fix.
  * Email addresses are now matched and opened correctly. Closes LP #139015
  * Double clicking a URL now selects the whole URL. Closes LP #129533
  * The default behaviour is now to open a single 80x24 terminal rather than
    four terminals in a maximised window. Closes LP #126219 and should force
    me to fix LP #87720
  * There are now hotkeys for switching between terminals, splitting terminals
    and closing them. Closes LP #149931 and #148622(thanks to Huanghe for 
    patches for this)
  * If there is only one terminal, closing it will not produce a quit message

  * Architecture should be all, not any
  * Fix section
  * Add AUTHORS file
  * Rename script to drop the .py
  * Handle the gnome-terminal profile better by offering command options
  * Fudge around some resizing issues
  * Fix child spawning to avoid segfaulting zsh
  * Misc. code formatting/style improvements
  * Refactor terminal splitting into one axis agnostic function
  * Flesh out setup.py a tiny bit more

terminator 0.3:

  * Implemented terminal closing, which correctly reparents its sibling (if
    any)
  * Updated documentation to reflect a serious bug with shells that aren't
    bash (or at least zsh)

terminator 0.2:

  * Support dynamically splitting terminals

terminator 0.1:

  * Fixed some distribution wording
  * Fix build-depends
