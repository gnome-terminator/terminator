    Emmanuel Bretelle.
  * Completely revamped config system which now transparently makes use
    of gconf settings if they are available, falls back to sensible

    from one and either scale the fontsize or not.

  * Close LP #179315 with a fuller fix that provides proper colour support

    translations. Closes LP #161120

    Terminator)

    gnome-terminal settings
  * Add Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab as options for switching terminals 
    (patch from Kees Cook)

    instead show the actual widgets that have been created. This 
    prevents scrollbars from re-appearing after they have been hidden

    thanks to Kees Cook for the fix.

    terminals and closing them. Closes LP #149931 and #148622(thanks 
    to Huanghe for patches for this)

    message
