## [v1.92](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator/tree/v1.92) (2020-04-18)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator/compare/1.91...v1.92)

This is the first release since 2017, while we are now a few years later a few things changed.

* New home on GitHub https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator
* New team under the lead of https://github.com/lazyfrosch
* Python 3 support finally released
* Some tedious bugs solved for current GTK and VTE

There is still a lot to do, and we need more help to keep Terminator available for
your daily use.

If you are interested in contributing to the project, please contact us, open issues,
discuss issues or help with whatever you can! Any help is welcome!

**Notes for packagers:**

* All scripts now use `#!/usr/bin/env python` as shebang, when you are using
  `python3 setup.py install` or similar all binary scripts should be automatically
   modified to the correct shebang
* Any feedback is welcome, please open an issue or join the community channels
