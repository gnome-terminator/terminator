Terminator
==========

by Chris Jones <cmsj@tenshu.net> and others.

## Description

Terminator was originally developed by Chris Jones in 2007 as a simple, 300-ish line python script.  Since then, it has become The Robot Future of Terminals.  Originally inspired by projects like quadkonsole and gnome-multi-term and more recently by projects like Iterm2, and Tilix, It lets you combine and recombine terminals to suit the style you like.  If you live at the command-line, or are logged into 10 different remote machines at once, you should definitely try out Terminator.

When you run **`Terminator`**, you will get a terminal in a window, just like almost 
every other terminal emulator available. There is also a titlebar which will
update as shells/programs inside the terminal tell it to. Also on the titlebar
is a small button that opens the grouping menu. From here you can put terminals
into groups, which allows you to control multiple terminals simultaneously.

## New home on GitHub

In April of 2020 we started moving **`Terminator`** to GitHub. A new team wanted to continue the work of the original authors.

You can find the project on https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator

## Origins

Terminator began by shamelessly copying code from the vte-demo.py in the vte 
widget package, and the gedit terminal plugin (which was fantastically 
useful at figuring out vte's API).

vte-demo.py was not my code and is copyright its original author. While it 
does not contain any specific licensing information in it, the VTE package 
appears to be licenced under LGPL v2.

## Licensing

The gedit terminal plugin is part of the gedit-plugins package, which is 
licenced under GPL v2 or later.

I am thus licensing Terminator as GPL v2 only.

Cristian Grada provided the old icon under the same licence.
Cory Kontros provided the new icon under the CC-by-SA licence.
